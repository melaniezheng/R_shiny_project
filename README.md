## R_shiny_project
#### this project explores US car accidents data found in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
#### helper.R pre-processes the data (as raw data is 1GB) and stores it into a csv file (250MB).
#### ui.R contains code for user interface.
#### server.R contains all data manipulation and visualization code as well as rendering output to be passed to ui.R
#### global.R is ran before ui.R and server.R and contains all libraries and loads all necesary datasets into variables.
